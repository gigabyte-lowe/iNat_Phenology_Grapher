# Phenology Annotations:
# termID for flowers and fruits = 12
# Flowers and Fruits: 13=Flowers, 14=Fruits or Seeds, 15=Flower Buds, 21=No Flowers or Fruits
# termID for leaves:36
# Leaves: 37=Breaking Leaf Buds, 38=Green Leaves, 39=Colored Leaves, 40=No Live Leaves

# this function is for fruits and flowers, but you could easily modify for leaves 
# (or any other phenology annotation, see 
# https://forum.inaturalist.org/t/how-to-use-inaturalists-search-urls-wiki-part-2-of-2/18792)
# by modifying the annotation ID numbers

# Implement your function here. Replace your "Diapensia lapponica" with your sp of choice,

#note you need the numerical place ID, sometimes iNat gives you one that is non-numeric

##### Phenology Grapher #####

# This creates a new, filtered and updated dataframe to remove the "No Fruits or Flowers" annotation to clean up the data, and adds two new variables: 
# "month", and day of year ("doy") which essentially allows us to treat dates as a continuous variable. 
# Feel free to clean up or edit your data as needed (based on your sample size or what annotations you want to use)!

    month = factor(format(date, "%b"), levels = month.abb),
    doy  = as.numeric(format(date, "%j")))

##### bar graph ####
####################

# This creates a bar graph that shows the frequency (count) of each pheno phase by month, using the "month" variable we created above.

##### density plot #####
########################

# This creates a density plot plotted by the "doy" variable we made and then bins it by month to make it easier to read.
# It shows the relative density of each pheno phase. I like this one because it clearly shows the observations starting in May and ending in October.

start_month <- 4   # Change these numbers to change your start and end view on the graph!

#### option 3 ####
##################

# This is another way to make a similar graph using months instead of day of year. Essentially, this sorts by month rather than by day. 
# This one will automatically graph based on what months have data available, but I don't think it does as good of a job at showing in what months the observations begin and end. 
# Also, the y-axis changes so it may be less accurate?

# A note on smoothing: under-smoothed data looks noisy and won't convey overall trends,
# while over-smoothed data erases valuable detail. We recommend starting low (adjust = .5)
# and increasing from there. The amount of smoothing you can get away with will
# also be determined by your sample size for each pheno phase.
